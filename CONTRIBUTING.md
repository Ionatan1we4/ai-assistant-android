## Setting Up the Development Environment


### API Key Setup

This application requires external API keys mentioned in Readme file  to function during development. **You must use your own key.**

* **Obtain Your Key:** Get your personal API key, refer readme file for details.
* **Security Note:** The `local.properties` file is included in `.gitignore` and **must not be committed** to the repository.

## Contribution Workflow

1.  **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2.  **Clone** your fork locally.
3.  Create a new, descriptive branch (e.g., `fix/settings-crash` or `docs/update-readme`).
4.  Implement your change. Ensure all existing functionality remains intact.
5.  **Commit** your changes with clear, concise, and descriptive messages.
6.  **Push** the branch to your fork.
7.  Open a **Pull Request (PR)** from your branch to the `main` branch of the original repository.

Thank you for taking the time to contribute responsibly!
